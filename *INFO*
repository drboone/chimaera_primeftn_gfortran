Chimaera  is  an  unusual  adventure,  written  by  one  of GGR users.
Consequently, the coding standards are not always what they should be.
This said, it also appears quite robust and is sufficiently  different
from the main-stream adventures to be of considerable interest.

The  game  is  supplied as a .run file and is built as such by the CPL
builder.  However, for the benefit of  those  who  are  stuck  with  a
pre-rev.19.4  Primos,  the CHIMAERA.OLD.BUILD.cpl builder is provided,
which will produce a V-mode .save runfile.  It should be  possible  to
run  CHIMAERA  in  R-mode,  but you would have to re-write GGRSUB.pma,
strip off SUBROUTINE MAIN from the main module, replace  RETURNs  from
theat module with CALL EXITs and remember to DBASE when loading it.

I  apologise  for  the  state of the GGRSUB source files. The game was
never converted to the up-to-date GGR libraries, so you  get  all  the
bad old junk.

Please  note  that  the  random number generation is deliberately done
internally within the program, instead of via library routines.   This
is  due  to the time it takes to initialise the standard random number
generator at rev.20.2 (two seconds!!).  CHIMAERA initialises a lot, so
it got really slugged down as the result.  (Before you ask, yes, there
ARE good reasons for it initialising a lot!).
